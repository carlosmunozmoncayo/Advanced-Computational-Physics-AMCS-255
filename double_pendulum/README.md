This is an HTML5-JavaScript code to simulate the behavior of a double pendulum in a frictionless environment. 
The motion equations are obtained by applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to the corresponding Lagrangian and the time integration is done with symplectic Euler's method.
The skeleton of this code is from Matthias MÃ¼ller's Ten Minute Physics.
