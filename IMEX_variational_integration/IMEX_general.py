#This file contains the implementation of the implicit-explicit variational time integrator presented by Stern and Grinspun, 2009.
#The solver is obtained by the discretization of a Lagragian containing a potential that can be splitted into fast and slow
#components. This is done by applying the midpoint quadrature rule to the fast potential and the trapezoidal quadrature rule to
#the slow potential, leading to an implicit-explicit solver (for fast and slow forces respectively).
